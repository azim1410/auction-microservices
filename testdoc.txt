Circuit Breaker Pattern
What is it?
A circuit breaker prevents your service from repeatedly trying to call a failing or slow dependency (like another microservice or a database).
It “opens” after a certain number of failures, and for a period, all calls fail fast (without even trying the dependency).
After a timeout, it allows a few “test” requests to see if the dependency has recovered (“half-open” state).
Why use it?
Prevents cascading failures in distributed systems.
Improves system stability and user experience.
